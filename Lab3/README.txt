Lab 3: Looping in RISC-V Assembly

-------------
DESCRIPTION
In this lab, our objective is to ask for a user input and (if over 0) to execute the program. The given integer will allow us to code a nested for loop which will print out the corresponding number (one per line) counting up in order from 1 (odd numbers only). Lastly, the two characters * and $ will alternate (starting and ending with $) in order to fulfill the needed amount of characters per line.
